      I love to travel with my family. Let it be to beaches, near our home town, or miles away from my bed. I love to collect sovenoiurs and but I also love to live every moment I'm in a new place. Embrace the new :)

            I love to draw and paint! Although I am not into it as much as I used to be when I am small, there is always something new to be inspired by or even practice just for fun. Still life is always exciting to try, even if it's something as weird as a statue.

  Silliness! One of my qualities that I always carry no matter where I am. Instead of being rigid and stiff I love to be loose and outgoing, no matter who weird it may seem like I am from the outside. Sharing jokes and having laughs is something that always has me smiling. Although I am a bit shy myself, I want to share smiles b ytalking to others so they can embrace their fun side!
